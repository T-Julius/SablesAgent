# Zimbabwe Sables Rugby Team Document Management System - System Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the system architecture for the Zimbabwe Sables Rugby Team Document Management System. The system is designed to ingest and integrate Google Docs and Google Sheets documents into a unified, searchable database with an intelligent workflow agent interface.

## System Components

### 1. Cloud Infrastructure

The system will be deployed on a cloud platform with the following components:

- **Application Server**: Hosts the backend API and business logic
- **Database Server**: Stores document metadata, user information, and system data
- **Search Engine**: Provides advanced search capabilities for document content
- **File Storage**: Integrates with Google Drive for document storage

### 2. Backend Services

The backend will be built using a microservices architecture with the following services:

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization
- **Document Service**: Manages document metadata, indexing, and retrieval
- **Search Service**: Provides advanced search capabilities across all documents
- **Notification Service**: Manages email notifications and reminders
- **Calendar Service**: Handles appointment scheduling and calendar integration
- **Audit Service**: Tracks all system activities for compliance and traceability

### 3. Frontend Application

The frontend will be a responsive web application with the following features:

- **Admin Dashboard**: For team administrators to manage documents and users
- **Player Portal**: For players to access relevant documents and information
- **Intelligent Agent Interface**: Natural language interface for document retrieval and workflow automation

### 4. Intelligent Workflow Agent

The agent will provide the following capabilities:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands user queries and requests
- **Document Retrieval**: Finds relevant documents based on user queries
- **Workflow Automation**: Handles email sending, appointment scheduling, and notifications
- **Inference Engine**: Extracts insights from document content

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Programming Language**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **API Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB for document metadata and system data
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch for document content indexing and search
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with Google OAuth integration
- **Document Processing**: Google Drive API for document access and manipulation
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer with SMTP integration
- **Calendar Integration**: Google Calendar API

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React.js with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux
- **UI Components**: Material-UI
- **API Communication**: Axios
- **Chat Interface**: React-Chat-UI

### DevOps

- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose for development, Kubernetes for production
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## Data Flow

1. **Document Ingestion**:
   - System connects to Google Drive accounts
   - Documents are indexed and metadata is extracted
   - Document content is stored in the search engine
   - Document metadata is stored in the database

2. **User Interaction**:
   - Users authenticate through the web interface
   - Users interact with the intelligent agent through natural language
   - Agent processes requests and retrieves relevant information
   - Agent performs actions like sending emails or scheduling appointments

3. **Notification Flow**:
   - System generates notifications based on events or schedules
   - Notifications are sent via email
   - Notification status is tracked in the database

4. **Appointment Scheduling**:
   - Users request appointment scheduling through the agent
   - Agent interacts with Google Calendar API
   - Appointments are created, modified, or canceled
   - Notifications are sent to relevant parties

## Security Architecture

1. **Authentication**:
   - OAuth 2.0 integration with Google accounts
   - JWT-based session management
   - Secure password storage with bcrypt

2. **Authorization**:
   - Role-based access control (Admin, Player, Coach, etc.)
   - Document-level permissions
   - API endpoint protection

3. **Data Protection**:
   - HTTPS for all communications
   - Data encryption at rest
   - Regular security audits

## Integration Points

1. **Google Drive API**:
   - Document access and manipulation
   - File metadata retrieval
   - Change notifications

2. **Google Calendar API**:
   - Event creation and management
   - Availability checking
   - Reminder setting

3. **Email Service**:
   - Notification sending
   - Document sharing
   - Appointment confirmations

4. **Team and Union Websites**:
   - API endpoints for document retrieval
   - Embedded agent interface
   - SSO integration

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Stateless microservices for easy replication
   - Load balancing across multiple instances
   - Database sharding for large document collections

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Document caching
   - Search index optimization
   - Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Auto-scaling based on load
   - Resource limits and quotas
   - Monitoring and alerting

## Deployment Architecture

The system will be deployed as a cloud-based solution with the following components:

1. **Production Environment**:
   - Fully managed cloud services
   - High availability configuration
   - Automated backups

2. **Staging Environment**:
   - Mirror of production for testing
   - Isolated from production data

3. **Development Environment**:
   - Local development setup
   - Docker-based for consistency
